		<h1>Practice Grant Proposal</h1>
		<p>This grant proposal was written for a grant writing class at Missouri State University. 
		I received a fantastic grade on the assignment, and ultimately an A in the class. 
		Although the letter was never sent out, it was written as if it was going to be. 
		I had to compile research on the subject, 
		including specific price details and the overall feasibility of the project.
