		<p>This piece was written for a medical writing class. As someone who was an RA in the past, the piece was written to cover a topic that I saw a prevalence of. Overall, the process was engaging and allowed me to advocate for an importance position at any college. Further, my research led me to recommend the implementation of specific policy changes, rather than just supplying information.
