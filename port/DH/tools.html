            <h2>Tools and Techniques</h2>
            <p>There is a difference between engaging with the digital humanities and being what 
			one might call a “digital humanist.” Those specifically working on digital humanity 
			projects need to have a vast skillset that allows them to both engage with the humanistic studies, 
			and the design of the project with digital knowhow.  
			Prior Stanford and current Harvard professor Jeffrey Schnapp listed several 
			skills necessary for those working on digital humanities listed them under three main categories: 
			technical, intellectual, and administrative. He are some of those skills, along with some detail of how 
			they might be used in projects. This list does not act as a total account of every skill one might use, but 
			rather an overview that shows specific use-cases of certain tools.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Database Knowledge</h3>
			<p>Used for managing, retrieving, and integrating datasets. Can be used for text analysis, metadata management, and data visualization, the preservation of valuable data, and collaboration.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>XML Structures</h3>
			<p>Used to encode, store, and exchange structured data, making it useful for representing and sharing information. 
			XML allows researchers to create digital editions of texts, encode metadata, organize data and analyze it within the field.</p> 
			<br>
			<h3>Scripting Languages</h3>
			<p>Used by researchers to automate data processing, streamline operations, work with datasets, complete menial actions, and other tasks.</p>
			<br>
			<h3><abbr title="Geographic Information System">GIS</abbr> Platforms and Spatial Data</h3>
			<p>Used by researchers to analyze and visualize the geographical elements of historical events and literary works. 
			This allows researchers to explore map historical data, and conduct geospatial analysis, enhancing the understanding of human culture and history through environment.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Interface Design</h3>
			<p>Allows researchers to create user-friendly and accessible platforms to present and interact with cultural and historical data.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
			<p>Researchers have to navigate legal considerations when using and sharing preserved materials. Understanding copyright, fair use, and open access principles ensures the safety and ethics of a given project.</p>
