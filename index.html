	<h1 style="text-align: center"> Hello, I am Clay Thornton, a technical writing student at Missouri State University.</h1>
<br>	
I've always felt that writing of all kinds can connect people. Coming from a background in creative writing, 
I am currently studying for my master's degree in Technical and Professional Writing because I love creating those connections. 
<br>
<br>
From day one in any technical writing program you will be told to "know your audience". 
This is the most important tenet in almost every form of communication. I believe that as a 
technical writer, I do more than that. Technical writing is the act of advocating for an audience. 
We are responsible for demonstrating information in accessible ways. Ultimately, we try to connect readers to information, 
not because it is something they want to read, but more importantly, because it is something they need to read. 
<br>
<br>
I have used this thought process in my Graduate Assistantship with the Computer Services Department at Missouri State University, 
where I write and edit help articles that guide students and faculty through issues they may have. 
<br>
<br>
On this website you will find more details about my experience in the “Resume” tab, as well as some work samples in the “Portfolio” tab.
